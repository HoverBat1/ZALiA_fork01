# What is this?
This repository is the **ZALiA** GameMaker:Studio project including most, if not all, of its contents. 

If you're just looking for the game to play, it can be downloaded [here](https://hoverbat.itch.io/ziiaol).

[**ZALiA**(**Zelda Again: Link is Adventuresome**)](https://youtu.be/BeVDs5hIxFg?t=705) is a *Zelda II: The Adventure of Link* fan game created by [**HoverBat**](https://github.com/HoverBat1) in GameMaker:Studio with the goal of creating more Zelda II content. Although it's written in GML(Game Maker Language), the gameplay is accurate to the original's because it is a direct tranlation of the original's assembly code. ZALiA's content is mostly vanilla Zelda II but includes a bunch of added content and a ton of QOL(Quality of Life) improvements.

Additionally, it would be most helpful if you joined the [Zelda Again: Link is Adventuresome Discord server](https://discord.gg/Z4H2RhwP4p) if you plan on contributing to the project. You can find some development files there such as my notes on what a specific RAM address is used for and a text file of dissected assembly.


# Disclaimer(s)
A warning that much of this code is messy, uses unusual solutions, and does not hold to our established formatting style - this is a result of HoverBat's disorganization, and his nature as a bat.

I'm still new the world of sharing source code and working with a community on a project. I'm not quite sure what to do next, but I'm sure there's plenty [TODO](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AZA-LiA%2FZALiA%20todo&type=code).


# Requirements
* **GameMaker:Studio 1.4.9999** - the IDE for editing and compiling this project.
  * If you don't have a copy of GameMaker:Studio 1.4.9999, I've been told [Undertale Mod Tool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool) can be used though I'm not familiar with it.
